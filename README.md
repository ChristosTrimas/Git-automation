this is a testing repo for the git automation scripts.
- gitpush.sh : a simple script to push in to an existed repository a new commit.
- createRepo.sh : creates a new directory and adds a readme.txt file
- pullFromAnother.sh : another simple script that helps your forked repositories stay up to date with the original repos.
